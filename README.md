Forking this repository is a nice idea. But, you can just clone it.

This project uses **[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)** to handle installation.

### Prerequisites:

* a terminal emulator (I'm using Gnome Terminal)
* git
* zsh
* zim
* tmux
* neovim
* asdf
* direnv

### Configuring

You may want to add, change or remove some files. Do it.

To configure what **dotbot** will do, edit `install.conf.yaml`.

### Installing

Run `./install`.
